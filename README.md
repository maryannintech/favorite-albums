# Favorite Albums

This is a mini-project to practice the lessons I learned on the intermediate course of HTML and CSS in The Odin Project. I showcase my favorite albums in this webpage. I tried to make it mobile friendly as best as I can, I also used a bit of vanilla JS so that it can play a snippet of audio every time the user clicks the album cover and it would pause when the user click outside of the album or hover out their mouse. I used all the new HTML tag that I learned and to be semantically correct.
