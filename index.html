        <img class="album1" alt="The album cover for Puberty 2 features Mitski sitting on the floor with her arms crossed and looking down. She wears a white T-shirt and black pants, with her hair slightly messy. The photograph has a grainy, lo-fi quality and is slightly blurry. The album title Puberty 2 is written in bold, white letters above Mitski's head." src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f8/Mitskipuberty2.jpg">
        <img class="album2" alt="Cover art for Janelle Monaes album Dirty Computer, featuring a close-up of Monaes face partially obscured by white lines and circles. Her eyes are closed and her expression is serene, with a hint of a smile. The background is a gradient of pastel pink, purple, and blue, with a faint hint of a circuit board pattern." src="https://media.wbur.org/wp/2018/05/0501_janelle-monae-dirty-computer-1000x1000.jpg">
        <img class="album3" alt="Photo album for Weyes Blood album Titanic Rising. A woman, dressed in a white suit, floats on a bed in a flooded room with a chandelier above her. The walls are decorated with ornate wallpaper and framed paintings, and there are scattered objects such as a lamp and a vase floating in the water around her. The overall atmosphere is dreamy and surreal." src="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5c7eafd9b8753a13dd400085/1:1/w_600/WeyesBlood_TitanicRising.jpg">
